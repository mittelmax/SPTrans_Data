# sptrans_Data

This is the code used to web-scrape and build a bus passengers database for SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) between 2015 and August, 2020. Feel free to change the code for different time periods. Just be aware that the column patterns may change over the years and I just gave myself the work of fixing them for the period after 2015. Overral I have to say the cleaning process was pretty painful. In this project I have used python to scrape the data and R to clean it. I still haven't done much with the database myself but I guess some cool metrics over Covid-19 and the quality of the quarantine could be made.

To properly run the scripts you'll need to create a directory named "Data" inside the repository
